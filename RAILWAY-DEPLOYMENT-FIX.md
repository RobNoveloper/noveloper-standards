# Railway Deployment Fix

## Issue Summary
The Railway deployment was failing with the error:
```
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "paths[0]" argument must be of type string. Received undefined
```

This was caused by an issue in the path resolution code when trying to find static client files in the Railway container environment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Path Resolution in `railway-start.mjs`
- Enhanced path checking with more robust error handling
- Added better logging for Railway environment debugging
- Added directory listing for the `/app` directory to help diagnose issues
- Implemented more graceful fallback to API-only mode when client files aren't found

### 2. Created `railway-build.mjs` Script
- Created a dedicated build script for Railway deployment
- Script copies necessary files to the `dist` directory
- Creates a simplified ESM-compatible `index.js` file
- Ensures the build process is robust for Railway's container environment

### 3. Updated `railway.json` Configuration
- Changed build command to use the new build script:
  ```json
  "buildCommand": "npm install && node railway-build.mjs"
  ```
- Set health check endpoint to a more reliable API endpoint:
  ```json
  "healthcheckPath": "/api/health"
  ```

### 4. Fixed JavaScript Compatibility Issues
- Removed TypeScript interface from JavaScript files
- Replaced with JSDoc type annotations for better compatibility
- Made scripts executable with `chmod +x`

## How to Deploy

### Development/Testing
Run these commands locally to test the Railway setup:
```bash
# Build for Railway
node railway-build.mjs

# Run Railway server locally
NODE_ENV=development node railway-start.mjs
```

### Production Deployment
1. Push changes to the GitHub repository
2. Railway will automatically deploy based on the updated configuration
3. Verify the deployment by checking:
   - Health check endpoint: `/api/health`
   - Contact form API: `/api/contact`
   - Newsletter API: `/api/newsletter`

## Monitoring and Debugging
The updated Railway setup includes enhanced logging:
- Path resolution attempts are logged
- Directory structure is logged in the Railway environment
- API request details are logged
- Email sending attempts are logged

## API-Only Mode
The backend now properly runs in API-only mode when client files aren't found, which is ideal for our split deployment architecture with:
- Frontend on Vercel
- Backend API on Railway
