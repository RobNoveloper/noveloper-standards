# GitHub to Vercel Webhook Setup

This document explains how the GitHub webhook has been set up to automatically deploy changes to Vercel.

## Configuration Details

The webhook allows GitHub to automatically trigger Vercel deployments when code is pushed to the repository.

### Implementation Notes

- **Webhook URL**: Using the Vercel GitHub integration endpoint
- **Protection Bypass**: Implemented using Vercel's Protection Bypass for Automation feature
- **Timestamp**: Setup completed on April 9, 2025
- **Last Test**: April 9, 2025 at 19:55

### Testing History

- Initial webhook test performed on April 9, 2025
- Verified that pushes to the development branch trigger Vercel deployments
- Second test performed with Protection Bypass parameter

This webhook enables a smooth workflow where code pushed to the development branch is automatically deployed to the development environment.

## Troubleshooting

If the webhook stops working in the future:

1. Check that the Protection Bypass secret hasn't expired
2. Verify the webhook is still active in GitHub repository settings
3. Confirm that Vercel deployment protection settings haven't changed
4. Check GitHub webhook delivery logs for response codes
