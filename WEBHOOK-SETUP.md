# GitHub to Vercel Webhook Setup

This document explains how the GitHub webhook has been set up to automatically deploy changes to Vercel.

## Configuration Details

The webhook allows GitHub to automatically trigger Vercel deployments when code is pushed to the repository.

### Implementation Notes

- **Webhook URL**: Using the Vercel GitHub integration endpoint
- **Protection Bypass**: Implemented using Vercel's Protection Bypass for Automation feature
- **Timestamp**: Setup completed on April 9, 2025

### Testing History

- Initial webhook test performed on April 9, 2025
- Verified that pushes to the development branch trigger Vercel deployments

This webhook enables a smooth workflow where code pushed to the development branch is automatically deployed to the development environment.

## Troubleshooting

If the webhook stops working in the future:

1. Check that the Protection Bypass secret hasn't expired
2. Verify the webhook is still active in GitHub repository settings
3. Confirm that Vercel deployment protection settings haven't changed
