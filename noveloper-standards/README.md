# Noveloper Development Standards

This repository contains standardized development practices, architecture patterns, and collaboration workflows for all Noveloper projects. It serves as a centralized reference that will evolve as we discover better practices through our collaborations.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

1. **Standardize Development**: Establish consistent patterns across all projects
2. **Accelerate Development**: Enable rapid startup of new projects
3. **Ensure Quality**: Maintain high standards of code quality
4. **Facilitate Knowledge Transfer**: Make it easier to onboard new team members
5. **Enable Reuse**: Create reusable components and patterns
6. **Document Decisions**: Record architectural and technological choices

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- **[STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md)**: Complete development standards document
- **[COLLABORATION-GUIDE.md](COLLABORATION-GUIDE.md)**: Working approach, communication style, and expectations
- **[templates/](templates/)**: Reusable code templates and boilerplates
- **[examples/](examples/)**: Example implementations of common patterns
- **[configs/](configs/)**: Configuration files for tools and services

## Current Projects Using These Standards

- [Noveloper Website](https://github.com/RobNoveloper/noveloper-website)
- HealthStaffPlanner
- Dashboard Master

## How to Use This Repository

### When Starting a New Project

1. Review the [STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md) document to understand the overall architecture
2. Study the [COLLABORATION-GUIDE.md](COLLABORATION-GUIDE.md) to understand the working approach and expectations
3. Clone or reference appropriate templates from the [templates/](templates/) directory
4. Set up the project structure following the standards
5. Include a reference to this standards repository in your project README

### During Development

1. Refer to the standards when implementing new features
2. Use the examples as reference for common patterns
3. If you develop a new reusable pattern, consider contributing it back to this repository

### Continuous Improvement

These standards are living documents that should evolve over time:

1. If you find a better approach, propose changes to the standards
2. Document new patterns and technologies as they are adopted
3. Update examples with improved implementations

## Contributing to Standards

To propose changes to these standards:

1. Create a branch with your proposed changes
2. Submit a pull request with a clear explanation of the rationale
3. After review and discussion, changes will be merged into the main standards
