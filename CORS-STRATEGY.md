# CORS Strategy for Noveloper Website

## Current Approach

We're currently using a direct approach to solve cross-origin issues:

1. **Frontend Strategy:**
   - In production (on noveloper.ai domain), the frontend makes API requests directly to the Railway deployment URL: `https://noveloper-website-production.up.railway.app/api/*`
   - In development, the frontend makes API requests to the local server endpoints: `/api/*`

2. **Backend Strategy:**
   - The backend uses a `setCorsHeaders` helper function to explicitly set CORS headers
   - It permits requests from all noveloper.ai domains, vercel.app domains, railway.app domains, and localhost development domains
   - Preflight OPTIONS requests are handled properly with 204 status codes
   - Detailed logging is included to help troubleshoot any remaining CORS issues
   - All responses return 200 status codes (even errors) to prevent browser connection issues

## Previous Attempts

1. **Custom API Subdomain:**
   - We attempted to set up an api.noveloper.ai subdomain
   - This would have allowed same-origin requests in production
   - Unfortunately, we faced persistent CORS issues when making requests from www.noveloper.ai to api.noveloper.ai

## Future Considerations

If we want to revisit using api.noveloper.ai in the future, we need to:

1. Ensure both the frontend (Vercel) and backend (Railway) are properly configured
2. Update Railway's custom domain settings
3. Thoroughly test the CORS handling before deployment
4. Update the getApiEndpoint helper function in contact-section.tsx
