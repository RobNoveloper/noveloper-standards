/**
 * Railway API Subdomain Configuration Helper
 * 
 * ✅ COMPLETED: The api.noveloper.ai subdomain has been successfully set up and integrated with the frontend!
 * 
 * This file documents the setup of the api.noveloper.ai subdomain for the backend API service.
 * Railway automatically provisioned HTTPS certificates when the custom domain was added.
 * 
 * The implementation followed these steps:
 * 
 * 1. Logged in to Railway dashboard (https://railway.app/dashboard)
 * 2. Selected the Noveloper website project
 * 3. Found the Networking section
 * 4. Added a new custom domain: api.noveloper.ai
 * 5. Added the provided DNS records to Namecheap (domain registrar)
 * 6. Waited for DNS propagation and domain validation
 * 7. Updated the frontend code to use the new API subdomain
 * 
 * Now the frontend can directly communicate with the backend API without CORS issues
 * because both are on the same root domain (noveloper.ai).
