/**
 * Railway API Subdomain Configuration Helper
 * 
 * This file helps set up the api.noveloper.ai subdomain for the backend API service.
 * Railway automatically provisions HTTPS certificates when custom domains are added.
 * 
 * Instructions for setting up the api.noveloper.ai subdomain:
 * 
 * 1. Log in to Railway dashboard (https://railway.app/dashboard)
 * 2. Select the Noveloper website project
 * 3. Go to Settings > Domains
 * 4. Add a new custom domain: api.noveloper.ai
 * 5. Railway will provide DNS records that need to be added to your domain provider
 * 6. Add those DNS records to your domain registrar
 * 7. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours, but often much quicker)
 * 
 * Once the subdomain is set up and verified in Railway, the frontend can directly
 * communicate with the backend API without CORS issues because both will be on the
 * same root domain (noveloper.ai).
