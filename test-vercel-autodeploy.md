# Testing Vercel Auto-Deploy

This file was created to test if Vercel's automatic deployment is working properly for the development branch.

Current timestamp: 2025-04-09 14:15:00

This should trigger:
1. A GitHub webhook to Vercel
2. Vercel to detect the change to the development branch
3. Vercel to create a new deployment using the Dev environment settings

If successful, you'll see a new deployment in your Vercel dashboard.
