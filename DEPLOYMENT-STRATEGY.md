# Noveloper Deployment Strategy

## Deployment Architecture

The Noveloper website uses a multi-environment, multi-service deployment strategy that maximizes performance, reliability, and developer experience. This document details our approach to deploying and maintaining the application across different environments.

## Environment Strategy

We maintain separate environments to ensure proper testing and quality control:

### Production Environment
- **Frontend**: `noveloper.ai` (Vercel)
- **Backend API**: `api.noveloper.ai` (Railway)
- **Database**: Production PostgreSQL instance (Supabase)
- **Purpose**: Live customer-facing website

### Development Environment
- **Frontend**: `dev.noveloper.ai` (Vercel)
- **Backend API**: `dev-api.noveloper.ai` (Railway)
- **Database**: Development PostgreSQL instance (Supabase)
- **Purpose**: Testing and QA before production deployment

### Local Development
- **Frontend**: `localhost:5000` (Vite)
- **Backend API**: `localhost:5000/api` (Express)
- **Database**: Local or development PostgreSQL instance
- **Purpose**: Developer iterations and feature development

## Deployment Workflows

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

1. **Automatic Deployments**:
   - Push to `main` branch → Automatic deploy to `noveloper.ai`
   - Push to `development` branch → Automatic deploy to `dev.noveloper.ai`
   - All pull requests → Automatic preview deployments

2. **Deployment Settings**:
   - Framework preset: Vite
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
   - Node.js version: 20.x
   - Environment variables: Set through Vercel dashboard

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**:
   - Automated Lighthouse performance tests
   - Visual regression testing
   - Key functionality verification

### Backend Deployment (Railway)

1. **Automatic Deployments**:
   - Push to `main` branch → Automatic deploy to Production service
   - Push to `development` branch → Automatic deploy to Development service

2. **Deployment Settings**:
   - Start command: `node railway-start.js`
   - Node.js version: 20.x
   - Environment variables: Set through Railway dashboard
   - Health check path: `/api/health`

3. **Database Migrations**:
   - Run automatically as part of deployment process
   - Use Drizzle ORM migration tools

### Custom Domain Configuration

1. **Vercel Domain Setup**:
   - `noveloper.ai` → Points to Vercel production deployment
   - `dev.noveloper.ai` → Points to Vercel development deployment

2. **Railway Domain Setup**:
   - `api.noveloper.ai` → Points to Railway production service
   - `dev-api.noveloper.ai` → Points to Railway development service

3. **DNS Configuration (Namecheap)**:
   - A records for apex domains
   - CNAME records for subdomains
   - TXT records for domain verification

## CI/CD Pipeline

Our continuous integration and deployment pipeline ensures quality and reliability:

```
Code Changes → GitHub Repository → (Tests & Linting) → Branch-based Deployment → Environment Verification
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **On Pull Request**:
   - Run tests
   - Run linters
   - Build check
   - Deploy preview environment

2. **On Merge to Development**:
   - Deploy to development environment
   - Run integration tests
   - Notify team of deployment

3. **On Merge to Main**:
   - Deploy to production environment
   - Run production verification tests
   - Notify team of production deployment

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **Application Monitoring**:
   - Vercel Analytics for frontend performance
   - Railway built-in monitoring for backend
   - Custom logging for critical operations

2. **Error Tracking**:
   - Client-side error reporting
   - Server-side error logging
   - Daily error report summaries

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Page load times
   - API response times
   - Database query performance

## Deployment Troubleshooting

Common deployment issues and their solutions are documented in `DEPLOYMENT-TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.

## Security Considerations

Our deployment includes several security measures:

1. **HTTPS Everywhere**: All environments enforce HTTPS
2. **Environment Variables**: Secrets stored as environment variables, never in code
3. **CORS Policies**: Strict CORS configuration in production
4. **Content Security Policy**: CSP headers configured for production
5. **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
6. **Regular Updates**: Dependencies kept up to date

## Rollback Strategy

In case of deployment failures, we have a defined rollback process:

1. **Immediate Revert**: Revert the problematic commit in GitHub
2. **Automatic Redeploy**: CI/CD triggers new deployment with previous version
3. **Database Rollback**: If schema changes were made, revert using migration tools
4. **Verification**: Verify functionality after rollback
5. **Post-Mortem**: Document incident and solutions

## Why This Deployment Strategy?

This deployment strategy was chosen to support Noveloper's needs for:

1. **Reliability**: Multiple environments ensure proper testing
2. **Velocity**: Automated deployments speed up iteration
3. **Quality**: Testing at each stage prevents issues
4. **Scalability**: Services can scale independently
5. **Developer Experience**: Preview deployments improve collaboration
6. **Reusability**: This pattern can be replicated for client projects
7. **Cost Efficiency**: Leveraging platforms with generous free tiers
8. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of environments
