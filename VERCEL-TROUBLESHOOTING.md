# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

Based on Vercel's official documentation on deployment triggers, here are key troubleshooting steps:

## 1. Ensure GitHub Integration is Properly Set Up

- **Missing Webhook**: According to your check, there is no GitHub webhook. This is unusual and could be the root cause.
  - When Vercel connects to GitHub properly, it should create a webhook automatically
  - Solution: Try completely removing the GitHub integration and reconnecting:
    1. Go to Vercel → Project → Settings → Git → Disconnect
    2. Then go to Vercel → Dashboard → Add New → Project → Import Git Repository
    3. Re-import your GitHub repository

## 2. Check Deployment Settings in vercel.json

- We've updated your `vercel.json` to include explicit deployment settings:
  ```json
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "main": true,
      "development": true
    }
  },
  "github": {
    "enabled": true,
    "silent": false,
    "autoAlias": true
  }
  ```
  This explicitly enables deployments for both main and development branches

## 3. Repository-Level Issue?

- If specific to this repository, check:
  - Repository size (should be under 3GB)
  - Verify there are no GitHub deployment blocks or branch protection rules
  - Ensure you have Admin permissions on the repository

## 4. Force Re-Installation of GitHub App

- Go to GitHub → Settings → Applications → Installed GitHub Apps
- Find Vercel and click "Configure"
- At the bottom click "Suspend" and then "Unsuspend" (this forces a refresh)
- Go back to Vercel and reconnect your repository

## 5. Check Repository Visibility in App

- On GitHub, go to Settings → Applications → Installed GitHub Apps → Vercel → Configure
- Make sure the "Repository access" includes your repository
- If it shows "Only select repositories", make sure yours is listed

## 6. Github Push Webhook Test

Vercel recommends the following test:

```
curl -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/dispatches \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
     -H "Authorization: token ghp_YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN" \
     --data '{"event_type": "deployment_test"}'
```

Replace {owner}, {repo} and ghp_YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN with your values. This simulates a GitHub webhook event.

## 7. Contact Vercel Support

If none of these steps resolve the issue:
- Email: support@vercel.com
- Include your Pro account details and project ID
- Specifically mention: "GitHub webhook is missing after multiple reconnect attempts"
