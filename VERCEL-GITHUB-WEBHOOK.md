# Vercel GitHub Webhook - Final Approach

After multiple attempts, here's the definitive approach based on Vercel's official documentation:

## Option 1: Use Your Deploy Hook Directly

Since we already have a working deploy hook, the simplest solution is to use it directly:

1. In GitHub, create a new webhook with:
   - Payload URL: `https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/deploy/prj_m8M0nIxMJpfBMPEAvcQV2vtPzS2c/McSJvPZSCO`
   - Content type: `application/json`
   - Secret: Leave empty
   - Events: Just the push event
   - Active: Checked

This will trigger your deploy hook whenever code is pushed to GitHub. It won't differentiate between branches though - it will always deploy to whatever branch you configured when creating the hook.

## Option 2: Create a Branch-Specific Deploy Hook

To handle different branches properly:

1. Go to Vercel → Project Settings → Git → Deploy Hooks
2. Create a new hook specifically for the development branch:
   - Name: "GitHub Development"
   - Git Branch: "development"
3. Use this new URL as your GitHub webhook

## The Last Resort: Full CI/CD with GitHub Actions

If the webhook methods don't work, create a simple GitHub Action:

1. Create a file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - development

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        run: |
          curl -X POST "https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/deploy/prj_m8M0nIxMJpfBMPEAvcQV2vtPzS2c/McSJvPZSCO"
```

This will trigger your deploy hook whenever code is pushed to the development branch.

## Important Note
