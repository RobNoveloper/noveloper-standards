# Railway Deployment Fix

## Issue Fixed
We fixed the Railway deployment error:
```
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "paths[0]" argument must be of type string. Received undefined
```

## Changes Made:
1. Created missing `railway-build.mjs` file
2. Fixed path resolution in `railway-start.js`
3. Added proper error handling

Push these changes to GitHub and Railway should deploy successfully.
