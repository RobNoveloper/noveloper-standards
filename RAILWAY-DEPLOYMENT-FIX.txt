RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT FIX

ISSUE SUMMARY
The Railway deployment was failing with the error:

TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "paths[0]" argument must be of type string. Received undefined

This was caused by an issue in the path resolution code when trying to find static client files in the Railway container environment.

CHANGES MADE

1. Fixed Path Resolution in railway-start.mjs
- Created a safe path resolution helper function to handle potential undefined values
- Added additional type checking for all path components
- Implemented multiple validation checks before accessing the filesystem
- Added more detailed logging for each path resolution attempt

2. Improved dist/index.js Entry Point
- Created a proper ESM entry point with dynamic import
- Added error handling for module loading failures
- Ensured clean error reporting and process exit on critical failures

3. Updated railway-build.mjs Script
- Enhanced the build script to create all necessary files
- Ensured proper file copying to the dist directory
- Added verification of the build output with directory listing

4. Previous Railway.json Configuration Updates
- Changed build command to use the railway-build.mjs script
- Set health check endpoint to /api/health for reliable monitoring
- Added restart policy for automated recovery

TESTING
The solution has been tested locally by:
1. Building with railway-build.mjs
2. Running the output index.js file directly
3. Confirming the server starts without path resolution errors
4. Verifying it can operate in API-only mode when client files aren't available

DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION
After deploying to Railway, verify these endpoints:
- Health check: /api/health
- Contact form: /api/contact 
- Newsletter: /api/newsletter

API-ONLY MODE
The backend now properly runs in API-only mode when client files aren't found, which is ideal for our split deployment architecture with:
- Frontend on Vercel
- Backend API on Railway

The server will automatically detect when client files are unavailable and work correctly as a standalone API server.
