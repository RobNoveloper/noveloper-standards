# Steps to Fix GitHub to Vercel Integration

## 1. Verify Repository Permissions

First, ensure Vercel has the correct permissions to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to GitHub.com → Your profile → Settings → Applications
2. Find "Vercel" under the "Installed GitHub Apps" section
3. Click "Configure"
4. Make sure it has access to the noveloper-website repository
5. Check that it has sufficient permissions (read/write)

## 2. Reconnect the Repository

Sometimes the connection needs to be refreshed:

1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Your project → Settings → Git
2. Click "Disconnect" to remove the current GitHub connection
3. Click "Connect Git Repository" and follow the prompts to reconnect
4. Make sure to select the same repository
5. Confirm all permissions when prompted

## 3. Check Branch Configuration

Ensure your branches are properly configured:

1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Your project → Settings → Git
2. Verify that "Production Branch" is set to `main`
3. Make sure there are no "Ignored Build Steps" for any branches
4. Check "Branch Behavior" for any custom configurations that might be blocking deployments

## 4. Review GitHub Webhooks

Check if the webhooks are properly set up:

1. Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Webhooks
2. You should see a webhook from Vercel with a URL like `https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/github/...`
3. Check its status and recent deliveries
4. If it shows failed deliveries, delete it and let Vercel recreate it in step 2

## 5. Test with a Protected File

Create a small change to a file that GitHub's interface will show prominently:

1. Update the repository README.md file
2. Add a timestamp or small change
3. Commit directly to the development branch
4. This often triggers webhooks more reliably than deep file changes

## 6. Vercel Support

If none of these steps work:

1. Contact Vercel support at support@vercel.com
2. Mention that you have a Pro account with custom environments
3. Explain that the GitHub integration isn't triggering deployments
4. Provide screenshots of your Git settings page

## Expected Outcome

After completing these steps, pushing to your development branch should automatically trigger a deployment in Vercel using your Dev environment settings.
